# Why aah framework?

There are several minimalist Go frameworks out there, each with their own set of goals. `aah`, however, is not a minimalist framework.

aah has been designed to:

  * Facilitate rapid web development
  * Be highly configurable
  * Maintain a very small memory footprint
  * Put security first
  * Achieve the greatest possible performance
  * Maintainable as application grow

...and so much more! You can read about the other features in aah by [clicking here](/features.html), or dive right into aah [technical documentation]({{aah_docs_domain_url}}).

<br>
Ooh No! the feature/enhancement that I'm looking for is not currently available in the aah framework. What should I do? Well, refer to the project [roadmap](https://github.com/go-aah/aah/projects/3) or reach out to me via [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/aahframework/community) or [Github Issues](https://github.com/go-aah/aah/issues) or [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aahframework).

<center>aah framework first public version `v0.5` released to the world on May 19, 2017.</center>
